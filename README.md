# Craft Brewery Analytics: Production, Sales & Profitability

## Project Overview

This project presents a full end-to-end analytical case simulating a real brewery business.  

The objective was to analyze production, sales, quality, and profitability data to identify inefficiencies, profit drivers, and strategic optimization opportunities.

The analysis covers financial performance, operational efficiency, discount impact, regional profitability, and product quality metrics.

---

## Multi-Tool Implementation

This analytical case was implemented in both **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** and **Power BI**.

- The **Python version** focuses on data cleaning, metric engineering, financial modeling, and structured analytical exploration.
- The **Power BI version** provides interactive dashboards with full visual representation of production, sales, segmentation, regional performance, and profitability metrics.

While the **Python notebook** emphasizes **structured analysis and tabular insights**, the **Power BI** version delivers interactive **visual dashboards**.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Data Sources

- `production_full.csv` — brewing batches, production volume, shifts, base cost
- `sales_full.csv` — revenue, discounts, channels, regions, profit
- `quality_full.csv` — defect volume, defect rate, quality metrics

---

## Analytical Process

1. Data loading and merging
2. Data cleaning and feature engineering
3. Creation of key financial metrics (profit, margin, cost per liter, AOV)
4. Sales analysis by channel, region, and time
5. Product segmentation by ABV
6. Discount impact analysis
7. Defect rate and employee performance analysis
8. Strategic recommendations

## Key Business Metrics

- €2.29M total revenue
- €1.37M total profit
- 60% profit margin
- 767K liters produced
- 1.56% defect rate
- 9x higher profit in XL segment vs Small

---

## Key Insights

- **Large and Extra-Large orders** generate the majority of **revenue and profit** — scale drives the business.
- The current **discount structure reduces margin** without significantly increasing volume.
- **Premium Reserve** shows the highest defect losses and requires process optimization.
- Summer months (May–September) represent peak demand — strong seasonality effect.
- Lombardia and Emilia-Romagna deliver the highest profit per liter.

---

## Strategic Recommendations

- Implement **volume-based differentiated pricing**
- Optimize **seasonal production planning**
- Reduce defect rate in high-loss products
- Focus on **XL (B2B) clients** as the primary profit engine
- Strengthen distribution in high-ROI regions
